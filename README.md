Price Elasticity of Cafe items using data science techniques and ML 
Calculating regular elasticity for products based on sales data
Overview
Price elasticity of demand is a measure of how responsive the quantity demanded of a good or service is to
changes in its price. It is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the
percentage change in price. In other words, it measures the sensitivity of consumer demand to changes in
price.
PE = (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q) Where (ΔQ/ΔP) is determined by regression coefficient and P and Q will be our mean
Price and mean Sales.
A price elasticity of demand greater than 1 indicates that the quantity demanded is highly responsive to
changes in price. This means that a small change in price results in a proportionally larger change in quantity
demanded. In this case, the good or service is said to be elastic.
On the other hand, a price elasticity of demand of less than 1 indicates that the quantity demanded is relatively
unresponsive to changes in price. This means that a change in price results in a proportionally smaller change
in quantity demanded. In this case, the good or service is said to be inelastic.
The price elasticity of demand is important for businesses because it helps them make pricing decisions that
maximize their profits. For example, if a good has a highly elastic demand, then a decrease in price will result
in a large increase in quantity demanded, which could increase total revenue for the business. However, if a
good has an inelastic demand, then a decrease in price will result in a relatively small increase in quantity
demanded, which could decrease the total revenue for the business. Therefore, understanding the price elasticity
of demand for a good or service is essential for making effective pricing decisions.
This project aims to create a regression model to predict the price elasticity of demand for cafe items based
on their prices and quantities.
In this work, we shall look at the sales of the items of a cafe. This cafe sells burgers, coke, lemonade and
coffee. The more variables describing sales you will add to the regression model, the more valid your general
results will be .
